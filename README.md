# Cost Conversion Calculator for Book Wholesale

## Author : Meerab Ahmad

## Project Description
This Pyhton program computes the total wholesale cost of purchasing 60 copies of a book. This costs incluslive of a, it,s a pretty straightforward program and helps illustrate how Python can be used for practical calculations everday, from computing business charges.

## Objective
If you wanted to calculate how much it would cost in total to buy 60 copiezs of a book, with the following conditions:
One book's original cost is $24.95
-40% off each book
Shipping is $3, $0.75 for each additional copy

## How it works 
1. Enter your book's cellar price
   The value book_cover_price is the full price of one book prior to any discount. For this one, it's 24.95 dollars.
2. Define the discount percentage
   The discount value is 40% and it is stored in a variable discount. This means that each book is 40% off for the buyer.
3. Limit the count of books
   The variable copies will hold the amount of books bought. Here, the number is 60.
4. Find the discount amount for each book
   book\_discount\_price = (book\_price \*discount\_percent) / 100 This provides us with the dollar amount discount per book.
5. Find out how much should one pay per book
   It uses the discount amount to calculate the unit_price by deducting this amount from the price of the product. This is saying how much one book is after the discount.
6. Plan for when they want to buy all the books
   Notice that total is its unit price time copies, after applying a discount, if any. This means the price in the total for all 60 books, not including shipping.
7. Determine the shipping fee
   Standard shipping is a flat rate of $3 for the first book = $0.75 per additional book. With 59 other books, that works out to 3 + (0.75\*59), the shipping charge.
8. Add book price and shipping for the final amount
   where the grand_total is the addition of the total book cost plus the shipping cost. this provides the full sum the customer will owe.
9. Display the finsal result
   The program outputs the final wholesale cost using the print function, indicating the total amount the customer will need to pay.

## Expected Result
If you execute the program, it will show:
Wholesale total for 60 copies = $945.45
That is the full price minus discounts and shipping.

## Skills Practiced
Talking about using Variables to Store and Manipulate Data
Excuting percentage operations 
- How to approach a pricing problem step by step Arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, divison)
Printing formatted output
- Modifying it to make it easier to read

 ## Recommendations for Revision
 Use input statements to let the user specify the number of books, the price and the discount
 Final amount must be rounded to exactly two decimal test cases
 - Show a breakdown of the cost i.e book total, shipping cost, grand total
Organize the code in sections by using functions

## Summary
This program gives a nice and simple example of using Python to solve real-world problems. It teaches you simple stuff like making variables, calculating percentages, and how to format that output for the human eye. It's most useful for beginners who are learning how to build programs that solve everyday business or finance tasks.](https://github.com/meerabac/Assignment-3)https://github.com/meerabac/Assignment-3https://github.com/meerabac/Assignment-3
